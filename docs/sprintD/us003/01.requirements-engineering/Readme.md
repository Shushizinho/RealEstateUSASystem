# US 003 - Register a new employee 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a system administrator, I want to register a new employee

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

> The company's systems administrator will be responsible for registering all employees (specifying
the name, the citizen's card number, the tax number, the address, the email address, the contact
telephone number and the agency to which it is assigned) and branches of the network (specifying
the designation, location and local manager) as well as preparing the system in order to facilitate the
insertion of advertisements and facilitate the use of the application.



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question**: The administrator when registering a new employee will also have to specify the category/office that he will perfom (for example agent, store manager, store network manager)?
>
> **Answer**: The administrator has to specify the role of the employee.

> **Question**: There is only one manager for each store and only ONE system administrator ?
> 
> **Answer**: Yes.

> **Question**: What would be the attributes of the System Administrator, Agency and the Roles?
> 
> **Answer**: The System Administrator is an employee. You can get the roles from the project description. Please check the project description.
Moreover, I just Answered a Question to clarify what are the attributes of an agency/store.

> **Question**: Can an employee be registered to more than one agency?
> 
> **Answer**: No
 
> **Question**: To register an employee I need to allocate him with a branch. To register a branch I need an employee (to be local manger) but I can't create the employee because I have no branch and I canâ€™t create the branch because I have no employee.
>
> **Answer**: Thank you for identifying this issue. We already updated the project description. When a store is created in the system, the System Administrator should not set the Store Manager.

> **Question**: Does the System Administrator have permission to create, edit, delete, or just create new employee registrations?
> 
> **Answer**: For now, the System Administrator can only do what is specified in the Project Requirements.

> **Question**: When registering a new employee, will the administrator set the respective employee password?
>
> **Answer**: The password should have eight characters in length and should be generated automatically. The password is sent to the employee by e-mail.

> **Question**: The system administrator cannot add an agent that already exists, the agent has two unique numbers that identify him (Tax number and Citizen's card number) which one should be used to identify the agent?
> 
> **Answer**: The tax number.

> **Question**: Must the Tax number and Citizen's card number follow any convention? If so, which?
> 
> **Answer**: You should use the tax identification number used for tax purposes in the US.

> **Question**: Does the system administrator select the agency to which the employee is assigned and his role from a list? Or does he just type that data? 
> 
>  **Answer**: The System Administrator should select.

> **Question**: However, it was replied to a question when a new Employee is created in the system, that a 8 digit Password should be automatically generated. How many digits should we go forward for password length validation in your software? And please confirm required special characters, etc.
> 
>  **Answer**: Sorry, I completely forgot that all our authentication systems require passwords with seven alphanumeric characters in length , including three capital letters and two digits. The password should be generated automatically. The password is sent to the employee by e-mail.

> **Question**: When registering a new employee, all the required data (name, citizen's card number, etc...) have to be filled or exists not mandatory data?
> 
> **Answer**: Required/Mandatory data that should be filled when registering an employee: name, the citizen's card number, the tax number, the email address, the contact telephone number and the agency to which it is assigned.

> **Question**: You've stated previously that an employee can only be registered to one agency so what happens if an employee wants/has to change agencies and needs to be registered to a new one? Should the system reject such operation or should the employee's previous registration be deleted?
> 
> **Answer**: For now I do not want such features to be included in the system. I will discuss your suggestion with the company shareholders and I will come back here if we decide to include such features in the system.

> **Question**: You have stated before that name, cc number, tax number, email address, phone number and the assigned agency of the employee are the mandatory requirements to register a new one, leaving out the employee's address and role. This confused me, because it wasn't clear whether leaving out those two characteristics from the answer was intentional or not. Futhermore, the role of the employee seems like too much of an important piece of information to be left out. My request is, then, for you to state whether or not that was a conscious decision in your answer.
> 
> **Answer**: The role is required.

> **Question**: I have a question related to the output data: when the system administrator is registering a new employee are we free to display what we feel is important or should a specific message be shown? I was thinking of displaying whether the operation was successful or not, is that fine or should something else be displayed as well?
> 
> **Answer**: A good pratice is to show the information and ask for confirmation.

> **Question**: When the System Administrator registers a new Employee, he should receive in his e-mail, the login ID and password. I wanted to know if we are supposed to actually send the credentials to the email, or if we have to approach this rhetorically and create for example a txt file with the information. 
> 
>  **Answer**: The credentials should be written to a local file named email.txt.

> **Question**: Can a single employee have more than one role? This is, when a system administrator is registering an employee, can he/she select more than one role for that employee or is it limited to one role per employee?
>
>  **Answer**: An employee can have more than one role.
